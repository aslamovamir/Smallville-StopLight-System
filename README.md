# Smallville-StopLight-System
A Windows Form App written in C# in .NET Framework to imitate the stoplight system at the town of Smallville. The program uses different GUI components to show 4 stoplights and changes their color depending on the state of the system at inner level. The system is regulated by the manual switch triggered by Forward and Backward buttons on the form.
